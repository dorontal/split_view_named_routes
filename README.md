# split_view_named_routes

A split view app that shows up in two columns if screen is wide enough or
in one column with a hamburger menu if the screen is small as when using 
a mobile phone.

This app also demonstrates using named routes.

Uses Andrea Bizzotto's `split_view.dart class` and
`split_view_scaffold.dart` - see the corresponsing copyright notice in
